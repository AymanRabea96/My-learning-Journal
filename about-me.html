                    Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to
                    the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner.
                I used to spend hours and hours learning,
                then try to create simple projects using what I learned
                or work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful
                to share what I was learning and most things about my journey
                with the world.</p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal
                site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
                After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only
                reflet on what I learned but also write short summaries
                of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that
                posting my learning summaries was also helping
                others learn and stay motivated.
